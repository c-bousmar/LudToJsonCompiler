        The name is a portmanteau of Neutron and Teeko, two games on which it is based.")
        (rules "Pieces move by sliding orthogonally or diagonally until blocked by the edge of the board or another piece.
        The object of the game is to arrange your pieces in a line of three either orthogonally or diagonally.")

Each player has eight cubes, numbered one to eight. During setup, each player can arrange the cubes as he or she sees fit within the area of their own color. The players take turns rolling a eight-sided die and then moving the matching cube. If the matching cube is no longer on the board, the player moves a remaining cube whose number is next-higher or next-lower to the rolled number. The player can move only in the direction of the opponent area. Any cube which already lies in the target square is removed from the board. The objective of the game is for a player to either get one of their cubes to the left/right side of the board or to remove all of their opponent's cubes from the board.\") (id \"4303\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/reach\") (author \"Eric Piette\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") (date \"2024\") } ) (graphics { (region Colour \"Home\" Edge) (player Colour P1 (colour Red)) (player Colour P2 (colour Blue)) (show Piece State Middle scale:0.75) (show RegionOwner) })"

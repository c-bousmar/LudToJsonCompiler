Two to four players, each player with two pieces. Played with two four-sided dice, marked 1, 3, 4, 6. Throws may be divided as the players see fit between their pieces. Doubles allow another throw. Players start with their pieces on the marked square on their side of the board. Pieces move along a spiraling track, starting in an anti-clockwise direction around the outer edges of the board, then changing to a clockwise direction when reaching the 32nd space in the track, and continuing in this direction in a spiral pattern until reaching the central square. If a player lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board, and the player must throw a double 1 to enter it again on their starting square. Pieces resting on a marked space are safe from being sent to the start. The goal is to reach the central square with both pieces, which must be reached by an exact throw. If a piece is 1, 3, or 4 spaces from the center, the player must throw doubles of that number to reach the goal. \") (source \"Parker 1909: 605-607.\") (id \"197\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/reach\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") (origin \"This game was played in South Asia., around 1909.\") } ) (graphics { (board Colour InnerEdges (colour Black)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour Black)) (board Colour Symbols (colour Black)) (board Colour Phase0 (colour 222 173 123)) (show Symbol \"thinCross\" {4 36 40 44 76}) (stackType 0 Ground) (stackType 1 Count) (stackType 2 Count) (stackType 3 Count) (stackType 4 Count) (piece Scale \"Marker\" 0.5) })"

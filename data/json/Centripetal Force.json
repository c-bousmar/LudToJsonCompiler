The first player plays with crosses, the second with circles. Each player, on his turn, must place his marker on the grid onto an empty cell respecting the following rule: the marker is dropped from one of the four sides of the board choosing a row or a column, and, proceeding in a straight line so that it goes inside of the board, it stops in front of the first obstacle (a marker of any of the two players, or the central square). Pretty much the same as what happens in Connect4, except here there are four dropping directions. If the marker reaches the opposite side without encountering any obstacles, the move is illegal. To win the game you need to be the first to form an horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of at least five of your markers. If there are no available moves, the game ends in a draw.\") (id \"3976\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/line\") (author \"Gabriele Soranzo\") (credit \"Diego Soranzo, Gabriele Soranzo\") (date \"1984\") } ) (graphics { (board Colour Phase0 <Graphics:boardColour>) (board Colour InnerEdges <Graphics:squareColour>) (board StyleThickness InnerEdges 0.85) (piece Colour Neutral \"Square\" fillColour:<Graphics:squareColour> strokeColour:<Graphics:squareColour>) (piece Scale \"Square\" 0.9) (player Name P1 \"Cross\") (player Colour P1 <Graphics:crossColour>) (piece Scale \"Cross\" 0.81) (player Name P2 \"Circle\") (player Colour P2 <Graphics:circleColour>) (piece Scale \"Disc\" 0.88) } ) (ai (bestAgent \"MC-GRAVE\") trainedHeuristics:(heuristics { (lineCompletionHeuristic) }) )"

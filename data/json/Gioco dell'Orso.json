One player plays as a bear, which begins on the central point, the other as three hunters, which begin on any three points on the inner circle. The bear plays first. Players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. When the bear is unable to move, the game ends and the players play again, switching sides.

White stones are placed on the white squares and black stones on the black squares. To move, the player must pick up one of his or her own stones and 'clobber' an opponent's stone on an adjacent square, either horizontally or vertically. Once the opponent's stone is clobbered, it must then be removed from the board and replaced by the stone that was moved. The player who, on their turn, is unable to move, loses the game.\") (id \"629\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/war/replacement/stalemate\") (author \"Michael H.

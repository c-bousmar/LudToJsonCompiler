On a turn either enter a piece not in line of sight of your own pieces, or move a piece a number of independent single steps not to exceed the count of that piece's enemy neighbours. If one player passes, to avoid ending the game with a 2nd pass, the opponent must place a piece if possible, or if unable to place, he may move in a way that enables his future placement. Otherwise, he must pass and the game ends. The winner is the player with the most pieces in play.

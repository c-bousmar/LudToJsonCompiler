Rules Scaffold is a drawless connection game played on the intersections of a square grid using stones (as in Go). Black is trying to connect N-S edges of the board, White E-W with an orthogonally connected group. First player places a single black stone on any grid intersection, after which the second player decides which color they will play (pie rule). Players then alternate taking turns. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point. Then, if possible, place a stone of your color on an empty point that is orthogonally adjacent to two groups of your color, and keep making such placements until no more are possible.\") (id \"1971\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/connection\") (author \"Andrew Lannan\") (credit \"Michael Amundsen\") (date \"2022\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour Black)) (player Colour P2 (colour White)) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour 178 151 100)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour Black)) (board Colour Phase0 (colour 250 210 148)) (board Colour Phase1 (colour 250 210 148)) (board Style Board) (board StyleThickness OuterEdges 3.0) (region Colour Edge (union (sites Top Edge) (sites Bottom Edge)) regionSiteType:Edge (colour Black)) (region Colour Edge (union (sites Left Edge) (sites Right Edge)) regionSiteType:Edge (colour White)) }) (ai \"Scaffold_ai\" )"

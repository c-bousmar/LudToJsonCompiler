An empty region is a group (chain) of empty points, and it is said to be adjacent to a stone if any of its points are. Setup: Starting with Black, place one stone each on any empty point. The setup is over as soon as the players have one stone each on the board. Play: On your turn, place a stone of your color on any point in an empty region that's adjacent to a stone of your color. After placement, first remove all enemy groups that have no liberties, then remove all friendly groups that have no liberties. In this phase, as soon as one player is the only one with stones on the board, the game is over and that player is the winner. The game is balanced with the pie rule.\") (id \"1982\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/territory\") (author \"Michael Amundsen\") (credit \"Michael Amundsen\") (date \"2022\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour Black)) (player Colour P2 (colour White)) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour 178 151 100)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour 178 151 100)) (board Colour Phase0 (colour 250 210 148)) (board Colour Phase1 (colour 250 210 148)) (board Style Board) }) (ai \"Cavity_ai\" )"

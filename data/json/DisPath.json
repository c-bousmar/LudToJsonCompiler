Every disjoint path needs to be fully disconnected from any other friendly path. The length of the path can be any integer (in this game, we have used k = 3). The motivation comes from the Disjoint path problem in graph theory. \") (rules \"Each turn, a player selects a graph element (vertex or edge) to create a disjoint path with size k.

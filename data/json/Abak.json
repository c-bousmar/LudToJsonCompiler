In the first phase, each player places one counter on one of the orange squares in the centre of the board. They continue to take turns to place their counters on a free adjacent square (squares are adjacent if they touch on the sides or diagonally by the points). The counter may be placed beside counters of any colour. Once placed, a counter may not be moved. During the game, if a counter is surrounded by more than 4 occupied squares, that counter is removed. Moreover, if then a counter becomes isolated, it is also removed from the board.\") (id \"784\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/connection\") (author \"Luc Chanteloup (used with permission)\") (publisher \"Lujees edition\") (credit \"Matthew Stephenson and Eric Piette\") (origin \"This game is from Le Mans (France), on 2015.\") } ) (graphics { (region Colour \"CentreRing\" (colour 195 82 20)) (region Colour \"OuterGoals\" (colour 195 82 20)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour Black)) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour Black)) (board Colour Phase0 (colour White)) (show Symbol \"knotTriangle\" \"Centre\") (show Symbol \"dot\" \"DotSites\" fillColour:(colour 195 82 20) edgeColour:(colour 195 82 20) scale:0.2) }) (ai \"Abak_ai\" )"

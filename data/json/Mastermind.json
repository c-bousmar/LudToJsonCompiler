These pieces will be hidden to the second player during all the game. The objective of the second player (called codebreaker) is to try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within a specific number of tries (corresponding to the number of rows). Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the board. Once placed, a feedback on his last try is provided by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.\") (id \"1157\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"math\") (author \"Mordecai Meirowitz\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") (date \"1970\") } ) (graphics { (show Edges Hidden) (piece Colour \"Marker1\" fillColour:(colour White)) (piece Colour \"Marker2\" fillColour:(colour Black)) (piece Colour \"Marker3\" fillColour:(colour Red)) (piece Colour \"Marker4\" fillColour:(colour Blue)) (piece Colour \"Marker5\" fillColour:(colour Yellow)) (piece Colour \"Marker6\" fillColour:(colour Purple)) (piece Colour \"Marker7\" fillColour:(colour Green)) (piece Colour \"Marker8\" fillColour:(colour Orange)) (piece Colour \"Disc1\" fillColour:(colour White)) (piece Colour \"Disc2\" fillColour:(colour Black)) (piece Scale \"Marker\" container:1 1) (piece Scale \"Marker\" 1.5) (board Colour InnerVertices (colour DarkGrey)) (board Colour OuterVertices (colour DarkGrey)) (board Background fillColour:(colour 255 250 220) edgeColour:(colour 100 95 75) scale:2.0) (show Line {{3 6}} Edge (colour Black) scale:2.0) (show Symbol \"disc\" (expand (sites Bottom) steps:\"NumRow\") fillColour:(colour DarkGrey) edgeColour:(colour DarkGrey) scale:0.666) (hand Placement Shared scale:0.4 offsetX:0.75 offsetY:0.25 vertical:True) })"

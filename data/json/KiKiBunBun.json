KiKi stones can move to adjacent forward diagonal empty cells and can jump over stones of either color to the immediate next empty cell, capturing any opponent stones that are jumped. Jumps are mandatory, and multiple jumps can be made in a single turn, but capturing the maximum number of stones is not required. Bun-Bun stones can only move to adjacent forward diagonal empty cells and cannot jump. Instead, they capture opponent stones by moving into their cell. Capture is mandatory, but only one stone can be captured per turn. When a stone reaches the last row, it is promoted and can move and capture backwards. The game is won by capturing all of the opponent's stones.\") (id \"4280\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/war/replacement/eliminate/all\") (author \"Jonathan A.

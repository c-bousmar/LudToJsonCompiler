The aim of each player is to colour the centre vertex of the coloured tree. It is a scoring based game, and it has two versions. At the centroid version, each player gets one point for correctly coloured a tree centre. In the second version is the degree version, where a player gets a score, which is equal to the degree of his last coloured tree centre. For both versions, all the incident edges of last move are uncoloured. So the tree is divided into subtrees. The game ends when there is no coloured tree available. The player with the highest score wins.\") (id \"694\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"experimental/graph theory\") (author \"Tahmina Begum\") (credit \"Tahmina Begum 01-06-2020\") (date \"01-06-2020\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour Shared (colour lightBlue)) (player Colour P1 (colour Red)) (player Colour P2 (colour Green)) (player Colour P3 (colour Yellow)) (player Colour P4 (colour Blue)) (board Style PenAndPaper replaceComponentsWithFilledCells:True) (show Edges ThinDotted (colour 127 127 127)) }) (ai \"Ilpion_ai\" )"

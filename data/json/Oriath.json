A regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbours; i.e. every vertex has the same degree. Moreover, if a regular graph has k degree, then it's called a k-regular graph. \") (rules \"Oriath has two versions: general and parameter-k. In both versions, the graph is initially uncoloured. Player alternate taking turns, in which the current player colours an uncoloured edge. In the general version, the last player to make a move such that the coloured graph becomes a regular graph wins. For the parameter-k version, the game is won by the last player to make a move such that the coloured graph is a k-regular graph. \") (id \"699\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"experimental/graph theory\") (author \"Tahmina Begum\") (credit \"Tahmina Begum 25-05-2020\") (date \"25-05-2020\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour 0 127 255)) (board Style PenAndPaper replaceComponentsWithFilledCells:True) (show Edges ThinDotted (colour 127 127 127)) }) (ai \"Oriath_ai\" )"

Four throwing sticks, marked on one side and blank on the other, used as dice. The values of the throws are equal to the number of blank sides up, when no blank sides are up the throw = 5. Throws of 1, 4, and 5 grant the player another throw. All throws are made before moving, and a piece must move the full value of one throw at a time. Players alternate turns throwing the sticks, and the first one to throw 1 plays as white and moves the white piece in front. When a piece lands on a space occupied by the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the space where the piece that captured it moved from. When a player has two or more pieces in consecutive spaces, these pieces cannot be sent backward in this way. If a player cannot use a throw to move a piece forward, it must be used to move a piece backward. If a backward move makes a player's piece land on a space occupied by a piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is sent to the place where the player's move began. If a player cannot move, the turn ends. Spaces 26-30 provide special rules allowing the player to bear off. To move beyond square 26, the player must first land on it with an exact throw. From there, the player may: bear off with a throw of 5; move to square 30 with a throw of 4 and bear off on any subsequent throw; move to square 29 with a throw of 3, but it must stay there until borne off with a throw of 2; move to square 28 with a throw of 2, but it must stay there until borne off with a throw of 3. Pieces in squares 28 and 29 are never required to move backward and bearing off is not required from any space. When a player lands on squares 28-30 and an opponent's piece is already there, the opponent's piece is sent to square 27 instead of 26. When a piece is in square 27, whether by being sent there as described above or by being forced to use a throw of 1 to move into square 27, the player may either move the piece back to square 15 and lose one turn, or may leave the piece in square 27 until a 4 is thrown, bearing the piece off. A player cannot move any other piece on the board when one remains in square 27 or 15 after being sent back to it, and pieces which normally would be protected from bring sent back because they are next to each other may now be sent back. Pieces in squares 28-30 are safe as long as a piece is in square 27. The player in square 27 may decide to give up trying to throw a 4 on any turn and move this piece back to square 15 and lose their next turn.

Four sticks, with one flat and one round side, used as dice. The value of the throw is equal to the number of flat sides up; when all round sides are up the throw = 5. A throw of 5 grants the player another throw. Players may enter a piece onto the board with a throw of 1. When a piece is entered, another throw is granted which must be used to move that piece. Throws may be divided among the pieces on the board as a player sees fit. Splitting throws in this way cannot be used to enter a piece, but the throw which is granted to move an entered piece may be divided, as long as the entered pieces moves at least one space. Pieces cannot land on the same space. If a throw does not allow a piece to move forward, it must move backward. All pieces must move in the same direction during a turn. If it is impossible for a piece to move from square 1, it must be removed from the board and entered again. If a player cannot move forward or backward, the turn ends. Squares 15 and 26 grant the player an extra throw. If pieces land on these squares as a result of splitting a throw, that throw must be fully used before the new throw is taken. A piece which lands on square 27 is removed from the board and must enter again. Players must bear off the board by an exact throw. Pieces may not move backwards from squares 28, 29, or 30. Pieces are not required to bear off unless no other forward move is possible.

Pieces begin on the board on the first row of spaces, alternating white and then black. Four sticks used as dice, with one red side and one plain side. Throws are determined by the number of plain sides that land face up, when all red sides are up the throw = 6. Throws of 1, 4, and 6 grant the player another throw. Throws are played immediately after they are thrown. The first player to throw a 1 plays as black, moves the black piece in front of the line of pieces one space, and then continues to play. Pieces which are in their starting spots may not move until after the piece immediately in front of them has moved. Pieces may not move past a group of the opponent's pieces which are resting in three squares in a row. Pieces may land on a square with an opponent's piece, sending the opponent's piece back to the unoccupied space furthest from the end. However, if two or more of the opponent's pieces are in a row, these cannot be sent back in this way. Pieces on squares 26, 28, 29, and 20 are likewise safe from being sent back. If a piece cannot move forward, it must move backward to an open space. If no moves are possible, the turn ends. A piece landing in square 27 is sent back to the furthest unoccupied space from the end. Pieces cannot be borne off until all of the player's pieces are in the last row. Pieces moving beyond the final space are borne off the board. The first player to remove their pieces from the board wins.

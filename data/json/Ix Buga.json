Intersecting with the third and seventh line on two opposite sides, a triangle, with a line bisecting the base and another bisecting this line and intersecting with the other two sides of the triangle. The apex intersects with the main board. One player plays as eight deer, which begin on points in the triangles. The other player plays with 80 hunters, half of which begin in the main part of the board. Pieces move to an adjacent empty spot along the lines of the board. The deer may capture an adjacent dog by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. The person playing as the hunters may place a remaining hunter on the board on any empty spot on their turn. The goal of the deer is to capture all of the dogs, the goal of the dogs is to block the deer from being able to move. \") (source \"DLP evidence.\") (id \"1019\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/hunt/reconstruction/pending\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") (origin \"This game was played in Mongolia, from around 1963 to 1966.\") } ) (graphics { (show Edges Diagonal Hidden) }) (recon { (concept \"NumStartComponents\" 88) (concept \"NumStartComponentsBoard\" 48) })"

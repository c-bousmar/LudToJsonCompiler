Sowing occurs from one of the holes in the player's row which contains counters, in either direction. Sowing moves in a boustrophedon path. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, the contents of this hole are picked up and sowing continues. If this hole is in the player's inner row, the contents of the opponent's hole opposite it are captured, and these counters are also used along with the hole in which the last counter fell for the sowing to continue. Sowing ends when the final counter lands in an empty hole. Play continues until one player has captured all of the counters.\") (id \"4205\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/sow/two rows\") (credit \"Alain Busser\") (date \"01-07-2024\") } ) (graphics { (board Style Mancala) })"

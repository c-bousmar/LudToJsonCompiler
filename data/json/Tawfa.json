These smaller stones are the counters. Another large stone in the center, on which three sticks, used as dice, are thrown. These sticks are flat on one side, round on the other. The throws are as follows: one flat side up = 1; two flat sides up =3; three flat sides up = 5; three round sides up = 10. Players move stones according to the throws.

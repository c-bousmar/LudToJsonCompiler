Players alternate turns picking up the counters in one of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in a hole with counters, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the inner row, any counters in the opponent's opposite inner row hole are captured, and if this capture was possible, any counters in the outer row hole are also captured.

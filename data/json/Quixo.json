The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board.\") (rules \"On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.\") (id \"1540\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/line\") (author \"Thierry Chapeau\") (publisher \"<a href=\\\"https: (credit \"Eric Piette\") (date \"1995\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour Gold)) (player Colour P2 (colour Dark)) (player Colour Neutral (colour Gold)) (board Colour Phase0 (colour Gold)) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour Gold)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour Dark)) (board StyleThickness OuterEdges 0.0) }) (ai \"Quixo_ai\" )"

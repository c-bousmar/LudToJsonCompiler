The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Play Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty cell. When the board is full, the winner is determined as follows: (1) Let n equal 0. (2) The player with fewer groups bigger than n stones wins. (3) If no winner is found, increase n by 1 and go back to (2). The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.\") (id \"1978\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/group\") (author \"Luis Bola\u00f1os Mures\") (credit \"Michael Amundsen\") (date \"2021\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour Black)) (player Colour P2 (colour White)) (region Colour (sites Board) (colour 250 210 148)) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour 178 151 100)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour 178 151 100)) }) (ai \"Yoin_ai\" )"

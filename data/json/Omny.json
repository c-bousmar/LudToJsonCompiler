Players take turns placing a stone of one's own color on an empty cell. A group is a set of connected stones of the same color. A cut of a group X is any set of connected cells (empty or occupied by either player) including no stones in X. You win by making a group such that none of its cuts include more than half the cells of the board. For serious play it is advised to play with a balance rule in force. In Mis\u00e8re Omny you lose if you make a group whose cuts each contain no more than half of the star cells.\") (id \"1529\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/group\") (author \"Luis Bola\u00f1os Mures (used with permission)\") (credit \"Michael Amundsen\") (date \"2017\") } ) (graphics { (show Symbol \"StarOutline\" (\"StarCells\") edgeColour:(colour 0 0 0 48) scale:0.5 ) (player Colour P1 (colour Black)) (player Colour P2 (colour White)) }) (ai \"Omny_ai\" )"

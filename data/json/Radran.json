It can be played with two or more player.\") (rules \"The graph is initially empty. Players alternate turns colouring an uncoloured edge between two of the vertices. Both players share a common colour for this gameplay. Radran is a score-based game. At each turn, a player gets a score, which is equal to the cost of his last coloured edge. The game ends when the coloured graph is regular.

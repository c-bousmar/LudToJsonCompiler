In each placement, players are not allowed to create a single 4-in-a-row of their color, unless that placement simultaneously creates at least one other 4-in-a-row of their color to win the game. This means that players may NOT make a single 4-in-a-row of their color on the first placement of their turn even if they can make a second 4-in-a-row on their second placement. In no event are players allowed to create 5 (or more) -in-a-row of their color. The first player to make simultaneous 4-in-a-rows of their color wins immediately, whether it was their first or second placement.\") (id \"1671\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/space/line\") (author \"Ken Shoda\") (publisher \"<a href=\\\"https: (credit \"Eric Piette\") (date \"2017\") } ) (ai \"Yavalax_ai\" )"

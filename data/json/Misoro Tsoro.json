Two counters in each hole in the players' outer rows. Two holes in each player's outer row are selected as misoro. Typically, the left two holes are chosen. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction, only in the two rows belonging to the player. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these are picked up and sowing continues. If this final hole is one of the misoro, the player may choose to end their turn instead of continuing to sow. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the inner row, any counters in the opposite hole in the opponent's inner row are captured. If there also are counters in the opposite hole in the opponent's outer row, these are also captured, but only if there was first a capture from the inner row hole. Players cannot sow from a hole with a single counter unless there are no holes with multiple counters. Single counters can only be sown into an empty hole. Play continues until one player has captured all of the opponent's counters, thus winning the game. \")) (useFor \"Ruleset/Misoro Tsoro (Observed)\" (source \"Matthews 1964: 65-66.\")) (useFor \"Ruleset/Misoro Tsoro (Observed)\" (id \"1290\")) (useFor \"Ruleset/Extra Counters (Observed)\" (rules \"The leftmost and rightmost holes are misoro.

Two counters in each hole, except the special hole (initially empty) and the two holes following it (initially 3 seeds). Sowing begins from any hole on the player's side, counterclockwise. If the final counter lands in an empty hole other than the special hole, the turn ends. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these are picked up and sowing continues. If the last seed falls into the special hole, one replays. The first player who manages to have all his counters in only one hole is the winner. In the Ambohimanga version when the last seed falls into the special hole, one plays again.\") (id \"4229\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/sow/four rows\") (credit \"Alain Busser\") } ) (graphics { (board Style Mancala) (show AsHoles {<Board:R1> <Board:R2>} Square) })"

To win the game, players must move one of their three workers to the sixth level of the town. Beginning turns : The first player places his three workers on the board, then the second does the same. Normal turns : Each turn, the current player moves one of his three workers in an adjacent position (in horizontal, vertical or diagonal, i.e. king chess move) then he places a building tile adjacent to the moved worker (in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal adjacent position). The level of a position (i.e. a grid square) is the number of tiles. Workers can move onto a position with zero, one, two, three, four, five or six tiles (but not with seven tiles) only if the level of the destination position is less than or equal to the level of departure destination plus two. There can be no more than 7 tiles per position. The primary winning condition is to get one of his workers onto the sixth level (i.e. on a position with six tiles), though players may also win if their opponent is unable to make a move.\") (id \"4281\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/reach\") (author \"Matthew Stephenson\") (credit \"Matthew Stephenson\") (date \"2024\") } ) (graphics { (piece Scale \"SquareLarge\" 1.0) (piece Scale \"TriangleLarge\" 0.9) (piece Scale \"SquareSmall\" 0.7) (piece Scale \"OctagonLarge\" 0.8) (piece Scale \"TriangleSmall\" 0.6) (piece Scale \"OctagonSmall\" 0.5) (piece Scale \"Marker\" 0.4) (piece Scale \"Pawn3d\" container:0 0.6) (piece Colour \"Marker\" fillColour:(colour DarkBlue)) (stackType None) } )"

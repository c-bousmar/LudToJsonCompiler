In the addition version, the graph is initially uncoloured. Players alternate turns, colouring an uncoloured edge in a common colour. However, in the deletion version, the game starts with all the edges coloured. At each turn, a player chooses to remove the colour of an edge. In both versions, the current player loses by turning the coloured graph into a regular graph. \") (id \"700\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"experimental/graph theory\") (author \"Tahmina Begum\") (credit \"Tahmina Begum 26-05-2020\") (date \"26-05-2020\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour Neutral (colour 0 127 255)) (board Style PenAndPaper replaceComponentsWithFilledCells:True) (show Edges ThinDotted (colour 127 127 127)) }) (ai \"Windir_ai\" )"

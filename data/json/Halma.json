The pieces begin play in opposing corners of the board, called the \\\"camp.\\\" Pieces can move in any direction to an adjacent square. Players can also jump any adjacent piece, including the player's own. Jumping does not capture. Multiple jumps in one turn by the same piece are allowed. The goal is to move all of one's pieces into the opposing player's camp.

There are three possible types of moves, explained below. Players will always have a move available, and must make one. Passing is not allowed. NON-CAPTURING MOVES Kings and courtesans can move to an adjacent, unoccupied square in any of the three forward directions. CAPTURING MOVES Kings and courtesans can move to an adjacent, enemy occupied square in any of eight directions, capturing the enemy king or courtesan by replacement. EXCHANGE MOVE You can transfer the top checker of your king onto an adjacent, friendly courtesan in any of the three forward directions, thus exchanging king and courtesan. In the Ludii implementation, the king is controlled like this: To make an exchange move you must drag or click the top piece. To make a step/capture move, you must drag or click the bottom piece.\") (id \"1993\") (source \"<a href=\\\"http: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/war/replacement/eliminate/target\") (author \"Mark Steere\") (publisher \"<a href=\\\"http: (credit \"Michael Amundsen\") (date \"2022\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour Black)) (player Colour P2 (colour White)) (piece Colour strokeColour:(colour DarkGrey)) (board Style Chess) })"

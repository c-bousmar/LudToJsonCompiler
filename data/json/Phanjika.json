Five pieces per player, which begin off the board. Seven cowries, used as dice. The value of a throw is equal to the number of cowries that land face-down; all cowries face-up equals 14 and there is a special rule attached to it. A throw of five (\\\"phanjika\\\") allows the player to enter a piece on the board. A piece that lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece is removed from the board and must re-enter. Safe squares exist on the board. The first player to remove all of their pieces from the board wins.\") (source \"DLP evidence.\") (id \"1173\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/reach/reconstruction/pending\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") (origin \"This game was played in India, from around 1126 to 1138.\") } ) (graphics { (show Edges Diagonal Hidden) (board Colour Phase0 (colour 223 178 110)) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour Black)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour Black)) (show Line {{6 95}} curve:{0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5} Bezier) (show Line {{6 12}} curve:{0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5} Bezier) (show Line {{12 101}} curve:{0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5} Bezier) (show Line {{101 95}} curve:{0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5} Bezier) }) (recon { (concept \"NumStartComponentsBoard\" 0) (concept \"NumStartComponents\" minValue:5 maxValue:) })"

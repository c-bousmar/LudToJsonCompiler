There are arcs of five holes branching from opposite corners. Can be played with two to four players, who can also play on teams. One or two pieces per player. Four stick dice are used, with one marked side. Each die is marked differently for a different value: 4, 6, 14, 15. The throws are as follows: All marked sides up = 5; three marked sides up = 3; two marked sides up = 2, one marked side up = the value of the marked side; zero marked sides up = 10. Players\u2019 pieces enter on the branching arcs. The second piece cannot enter before the first one leaves the arc. Each player can choose which direction they wish to move around the board, but they must continue in this direction for the rest of the game. If a player lands on the same spot as the opponent, the opponent\u2019s piece is removed from the board and must re-enter. Player must make an exact throw to get a piece off the board after reentering the arc from the spot where the player entered the board. The player to get both of their pieces off the board first wins.\") (source \"Culin 1907: 146-148.\") (id \"204\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/escape\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") } ) (graphics { (show Edges Hidden) (show Symbol \"disc\" \"AllSites\" Vertex fillColour:(colour Grey) edgeColour:(colour Black) scale:0.5) (piece Rename piece:\"Die1\" \"KintsDice1\") (piece Rename piece:\"Die2\" \"KintsDice2\") (piece Rename piece:\"Die3\" \"KintsDice3\") (piece Rename piece:\"Die4\" \"KintsDice4\") (piece Style \"Die\" NativeAmericanDice) }) (ai \"Ghingskoot_ai\" )"

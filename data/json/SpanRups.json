A spanning tree T of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of G. The spanning caterpillar tree C is a spanning tree in which all the vertices are within distance 1 from a central path.\") (rules \"Starting of the game, the player can select the goal of the puzzle, which can be spanning tree or caterpillar tree. This game has two versions: addition and deletion version. At the addition version, the board graph is initially uncoloured. Players take turns to colour an uncoloured edge by a common colour. After colouring some edges, if the player makes a spanning tree (or caterpillar tree), he wins. At the other version, the game starts with all the same coloured edges. At each turn, a player chooses to remove the colour of a coloured edge. After removing some coloured edges, if the player makes his desired tree (spanning or caterpillar tree), he wins.\") (id \"695\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"experimental/graph theory\") (author \"Tahmina Begum\") (credit \"Tahmina Begum 22-05-2020\") (date \"22-05-2020\") } ) (graphics { (player Colour P1 (colour 0 127 255)) (board Style PenAndPaper replaceComponentsWithFilledCells:True) (show Edges ThinDotted (colour 127 127 127)) }) (ai \"SpanRups_ai\" )"

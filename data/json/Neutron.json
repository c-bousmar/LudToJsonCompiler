Each player has a set of soldiers that move in a straight line (orthogonal or diagonal) as far as they can until they reach an edge or another stone. The neutron is a special piece that moves like a soldier, and players must first move the neutron and then one of their soldiers on their turn. The first player does not move the neutron on their first turn. The game is won by the player who moves the neutron to their first row (the row where their soldiers start) or by stalemating their opponent so that they cannot complete their turn. There is no capturing in the game.\") (id \"4285\") (source \"<a href='https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/reach\") (author \"Robert A.

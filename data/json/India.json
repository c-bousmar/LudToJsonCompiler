On each turn, a player must either drop an off-board stone onto a friendly stack, move a friendly stack to an adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) empty cell, or capture an adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) enemy stack with exactly one less stone than the moved stack, with captured stones being removed from play. The goal of the game is to be the first player to move a stack of size one to the last row on the opposite side of the board, and a player who has no stacks of size one left on the board loses the game.\") (id \"4277\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/reach\") (author \"Martin Windischer \") (credit \"Achille Morenville\") (date \"2003\") } )"

Each player gains one action point at the start of their turn. Players may use an action point during their turn to perform one of four actions: - Move their tank to an adjacent space. - Shoot at another tank within shooting range, deducting one point of health. - Trade with another tank within shooting range, increasing the owning players action points by one. - Increase the shooting range of their tank by one space. Players can pass to conserve action points between turns. A player loses if their tank reaches zero health.\") (id \"1625\") (source \"<a href=\\\"https: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/war/replacement/eliminate/all\") (author \"Luke Muscat and Joe Gatling\") (credit \"Matthew Stephenson\") } ) (graphics { (show Piece Value CornerLeft offsetImage:true valueOutline:true) (show Piece State CornerRight offsetImage:true valueOutline:true) }) (ai \"Tank Tactics_ai\" )"

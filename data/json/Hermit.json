Although the game is static (pieces do not move), there is still a dynamic effect because legal placements turn on and off! Hermit can be played on the nodes of any graph, even on a four-dimensional tesseract! Twelve 2-dimensional graphs are included. Some graph require a neutral token to prevent symmetric play by the second player.\") (rules \"Hermit is a two player abstract game in which players drop stones to create edgewise connected, owned groups of odd sizes 1, 3 and 5 exclusively. The game ends when neither player can legally place a stone. The player with the most groups on the board at game's end wins. Ties are broken by the most groups of size 1 (hermits), then by the most groups of size 3, and finally, the last player to place a stone wins. Scores are formatted 'aa1133', where aa = count of all groups, 11 = count of size 1 groups, and 33 = count of size 3 groups.

It is played on a board that is shaped like a six-pointed star with 121 holes for the pieces. Each point of the star has ten colored spheres and the goal of the game is to move all of one's pieces into the opposite point of the star. Players can move a piece to one adjacent hole, or can jump either their own or opponent's pieces. This does not result in capturing, and jumping is not mandatory. When fewer than six people play, players can play with only one color of pieces, but if two or three people play they can use more than one color, but each player must use an equal number of pieces.\") (source \"https: (id \"71\") (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/race/fill\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") } ) (graphics { (board Colour InnerEdges (colour 120 190 240)) (board Colour OuterEdges (colour 120 190 240)) (board Colour Phase0 (colour 210 230 255)) (board StyleThickness OuterEdges 2.0) (region Colour \"Home\" P1 (colour Green)) (region Colour \"Home\" P2 (colour Blue)) (region Colour \"Home\" P3 (colour Pink)) (region Colour \"Home\" P4 (colour White)) (region Colour \"Home\" P5 (colour Black)) (region Colour \"Home\" P6 (colour Red)) }) (ai \"Chinese Checkers_ai\" )"

A chameleon is placed on each tile, matching its colour. At the beginning of each turn, chameleons that haven't moved in two turns change colours to that of the tile below them. The center tile, which is not coloured, always inverts the color of the chameleon placed on it. Chameleons can move to any adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) empty tile. They can also jump over an enemy chameleon to capture it. If a player can capture a chameleon, they must do so. A player wins when no chameleons of the other colour are left on the board.\") (id \"4268\") (source \"<a href=\\\"http: (version \"1.3.14\") (classification \"board/war/leaping/orthogonal\") (author \"Chris Huntoon\") (credit \"Eric Piette\") (date \"2000\") } ) (graphics { (board Colour OuterEdges (colour Black)) (board StyleThickness InnerEdges 0.5) (board Colour InnerEdges (colour Black)) (player Colour P1 (colour Red)) (player Colour P2 (colour Green)) (piece Style Tile) (piece Foreground \"Chameleon1\" image:\"Counter\" fillColour:(colour Red) scale:0.8) (piece Foreground \"Chameleon2\" image:\"Counter\" fillColour:(colour Green) scale:0.8) (region Colour \"RedTiles\" Cell (colour Red)) (region Colour \"GreenTiles\" Cell (colour Green)) (region Colour \"Center\" Cell (colour LightTan)) } )"

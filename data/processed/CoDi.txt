        (rules "The board depicts the 20 corners of the dodecahedron and each corner is connected to exactly 3 other corners. On his turn the player puts a stone of his color on one of the 20 corners. Stones from other colors on neighbouring corners are removed if the played stone if there already was a stone of the other player's color adjacent to them before. The game ends when all 20 corners have stones on them with the player with the most stones on the board being the winner. The game has also a limit of 80 moves.")

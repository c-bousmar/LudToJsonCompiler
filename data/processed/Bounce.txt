A group here is a monocolored, orthogonally interconnected group of checkers. If, at the conclusion of your turn, all of your checkers are in one group, you win. Starting with Red, players take turns moving one of their checkers to an unoccupied square. The checker you move must be part of a larger group after your move than it was before your move. If you don't have any legal moves available on your turn, you must instead remove any one of your checkers from the board, concluding your turn.")

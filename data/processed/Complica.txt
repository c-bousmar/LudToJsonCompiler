        (description "At first glance, this early Knizia title may seem like an easier version of Connect Four played on a 4x7 grid. However, in Complica, when a piece is placed, it does not remain there for the entire game.")
        (rules "The game is played on a 7x4 board. On each turn, players must drop a stone of their color into the lowest possible empty cell of a column. If the column is full, the player's stone is placed on top and the bottom stone is removed. A player wins by creating a line of four stones of their own color, either diagonally or orthogonally. If both players have a 4-in-a-row, the game continues.")

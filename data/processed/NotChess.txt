A knight jumps one orthogonal cell and then to a diagonal at the same direction (like the chess Knight) into an empty cell, or into an enemy piece (capturing it). After the move, the moved piece changes status (the soldier becomes a knight, and vice versa). Wins the player that captures all enemy pieces.")

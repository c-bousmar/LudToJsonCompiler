            TURN - A player must move one of his stones sliding it orthogonally or diagonally over a line of empty cells. Stones inside the can cannot move.
            
        GOAL - Wins the player that moves all his stones into the can. If it is no longer possible to move the remaining stones into the can, wins the player with more stones there.")

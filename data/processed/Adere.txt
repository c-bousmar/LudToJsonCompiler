        (rules "The game is played on a triangular board made up of hexagonal tiles. On each turn, a player can either place a stone of their color on an empty space on the board, or they can move a stone of their color from the top of a stack onto a neighboring opponent's stack of exactly the same height. A player wins the game if, at the start of their turn, a single group of their stones connects all three sides of the board. A stack belongs to the player who has a stone of their color on top of it.")

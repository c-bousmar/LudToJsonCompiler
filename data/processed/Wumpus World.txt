        (description "Wumpus World is a common puzzle used for AI planning algorithms. In 'Wumpus World' the player is exploring a cave, seeking a pile of gold, while avoiding falling into pits and the wumpus.")
        (rules "A grid of rooms contains one room with a wumpus, one or more rooms with pits, and one room with gold. The player must both find the gold and kill the wumpus to win.
            
            During a turn, the player may either move to an adjacent room or fire an arrow along an orthogonal path.
            
            The arrow will continue along the path until it either hits a wall or hits the wumpus, killing it.
            
            If the player moves into a room with a pit, they will fall and die. If the player moves into a room with a living wumpus, the wumpus will eat the player. If the player moves into a room with the gold, they will pick up the gold automatically, satisfying one of the win conditions.
            
        As warning, if a room adjacent to the player has a pit, they will feel a breeze. If the room is adjacent to the wumpus, they will smell a stench.")

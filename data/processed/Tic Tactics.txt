The pieces may be in a single 3x3 square or bridge two of the 3x3 squares. The board consists of nine 3x3 squares with 1x1 squares that connect all nine 3x3 squares. All four colors are used when playing. With two players each player plays two colors. Each player plays one disc each turn and alternates between their two colors.")

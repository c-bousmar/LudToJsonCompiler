            It can be played on a variety of boards and starting positions with 2 or more players.
            
        The original idea was for 2 players on a hex board with 3 pieces per player, and called Trisect.")

            To 'live', a piece needs a path of empty board cells leading to another piece of its own kind.
            
            Play:
            Move one of your living pieces a single step and remove the cell of the board that it used to occupy.
            
            A player with no live pieces at the end of their turn, loses.
        The winner is the last to survive.")

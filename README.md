# Compiler from .lud to .json (WIP)
This is a compiler made to create .json files based on .lud files while keeping content integrity.

Note: idealy, should change the behavior of the parser to work char by char for the entire file.

## TODO parsing
- [x] define
- [ ] game
- [x] option
- [x] rulesets
- [ ] metadata

Game and Metadata are both treated as one simple string for now.

## Structure
```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ json/             # Parsed JSON files

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fetch_lud_files.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parse_json.py
â”‚â”€â”€ .gitignore
â”‚â”€â”€ poetry.lock              # Locked dependencies for Poetry
â”‚â”€â”€ pyproject.toml           # Poetry configuration file
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Setup

1. **Install Poetry** (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```
   This ensures all dependencies are installed according to `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Activating the Virtual Environment**:
   ```sh
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Running Scripts Inside Poetry Environment**:
   ```sh
   poetry run python script.py
   ```

## Usage
If a `"game name"` is given, the script only tries for that specific game, do it for all otherwise.
#### Running everything together:
```shell
python main.py <"game name">
```

#### Fetch `.lud` files:
```shell
python src/fetch_lud_files.py <"game name">
```

#### Clean `.lud` files (because of the format variety introduced by humans) and save in in `.txt` format:
```shell
python src/clean_files.py <"game name">
```

#### Parse cleaned `.txt` format content to `.json`:
```shell
python src/parse_json.py <"game name">
```
